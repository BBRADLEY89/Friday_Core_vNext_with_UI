**User:** Tell me about AI systems

**Friday:** AI systems, or Artificial Intelligence systems, are designed to mimic human intelligence. They're capable of learning, reasoning, problem-solving, perception, and language understanding. At a high level, AI can be categorized into two types: narrow AI, which is designed to perform a narrow task (like facial recognition or internet searches), and general AI, which can understand, learn, and apply knowledge in a broader, more human-like way.

The key components of AI systems typically include Machine Learning (ML), where algorithms learn from data, and Deep Learning, a subset of ML that makes the computation of multi-layer neural networks feasible. It's through these mechanisms that AI systems can process large amounts of data and make predictions or decisions without human intervention. 

AI is used in many fields that we interact with daily: surveillance systems use AI for face recognition, email services use AI to filter out spam, banks use AI for credit scoring, and the medical field uses AI to predict diseases and plan treatments.

Do you want more detailed information about a specific aspect of AI systems?

**User:** Does Contract C-2025-001 contain payment deadline conflicts?

**Friday:** Yes, Contract C-2025-001 contains a payment deadline conflict. There are two clauses in the contract that contradict each other:

1. Clause 001 states that payment is due immediately upon delivery.
2. Clause 002 states that payment is due within 30 days of invoice.

This creates a conflict as both clauses have different payment deadlines.
